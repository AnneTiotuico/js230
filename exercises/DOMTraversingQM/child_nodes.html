<!-- 
  How many direct and indirect child nodes does each parent node — starting with the element with an id of 1 — have in the DOM generated by the following HTML:
 -->

 <div id="1">
  <h1 id="2">Hello, <em id="3">World</em></h1>
  <p id="4">
    Welcome to wonderland. This is an
    <span id="5">awesome</span> place.
  </p>
  <a href="#" id="6"><strong id="7">Enter</strong></a>
  <div id="8"><p id="9"><a href="#" id="10">Go back</a></p></div>
</div>


<!-- 
Consider the following when counting the direct and indirect child nodes for each parent node:

Any DOM node that has at least one child node is a parent node.
Indirect child nodes are the child nodes of child nodes.
 -->

 <!-- 
id 1 (div): 
9 direct child nodes: empty #text, h1, empty #text, p, empty #text, a, empty #text, div, empty #text
12 indirect child nodes: #text, em, #text, #text, span, #text, #text, strong, #text, p, a, #text

id 2 (h1):
2 direct child nodes: #text, em
1 indirect child node: #text

id 3 (em):
1 direct child node: em
0 indirect child nodes

id 4 (p):
3 direct child nodes: #text, span, #text
1 indirect child noe: #text

id 5 (span): 
1 direct child node: #text
0 indirect child nodes

id 6 (a):
1 direct child node: strong
1 indirect child node: #text

id 7 (strong):
1 direct child node: #text
0 indirect child nodes

id 8 (div):
1 direct child node: p
2 indirect child nodes: a, #text

id 9 (p):
1 direct child node: a
1 indirect child node: #text

id 10(a):
1 direct child node: #text
0 indirect child nodes

LS Solution:
Using the above DOM representation of ALL the nodes, we can count the direct and indirect child nodes for each parent node. Here is the table summarizing the count:

Parent Node ID	Direct Child Nodes	Indirect Child Nodes
1	9	12
2	2	1
3	1	0
4	3	1
5	1	0
6	1	1
7	1	0
8	1	2
9	1	1
10	1	0


Further Exploration
Write code that returns the number of direct and indirect child nodes for a given parent node as an array.

// sample output
> childNodes(1);
= [9, 12]
> childNodes(4);
= [3, 1]
> childNodes(9);
= [1, 1]
